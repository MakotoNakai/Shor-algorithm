# Shor-algorithm

## The problem this algorithm aims to solve  
This problem is the algorithm which can solve the factoring problem , which is one of the NP problems, in polynomial time.   For instance, this can find b and c, if a = b*c.

## The mathematical explanation  
This problem can be solved by the following order.

1.Pick two numbers N and a.  N is the number you are trying to factor, and a is something between 1 to N and does not have any common divisor with N.  
  
2.
